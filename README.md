# ReactMeals
This repository shows a class project from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºllers Udemy / Academind class on React. It leverages many techniques, crucial to intermediate React projects.

## Key concepts
This website demonstrates a dummy food ordering app, which teaches students how components interact, how advanced states are best handled via Context API, how to connect a React App with a single Firebase backend, add simple frontend validation for a better User Experience and how to leverage loading and error states. It explicitly details form validation and asynchronous coding for a realistic (but small) web application.
